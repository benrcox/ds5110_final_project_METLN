This folder contains the Jupiter notebook of the analysis completed to examine the Digital vs. Print subscriptions types for the METLN group project.

Notes: The Folium maps are currently examining the top 25 and lowest 25 cities for digital, or digital vs. print, subscriptions in Maine. 
The maps were re-run (as of 12/7/2025) with 'normalized' city names and might vary slightly from the map screenshots that were shown during the group presentations on 12/2/2025.
